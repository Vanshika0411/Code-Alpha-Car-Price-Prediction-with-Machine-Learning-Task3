# Code Alpha Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning-Task3
ðŸš— Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning â€“ CodeAlpha Task 3
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on various features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, seller type, transmission, etc. It is developed as part of the CodeAlpha internship.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature selection and encoding

Training regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation using accuracy metrics

Files included:

car data.csv â€“ Dataset containing car features and prices

vanshika-jain-car-price-prediction.ipynb â€“ Jupyter Notebook with complete code for data analysis and model training

README.md â€“ Project summary
